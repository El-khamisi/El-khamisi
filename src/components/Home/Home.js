                But my passion for technology runs deeper than just my
                professional experience. I am truly obsessed with creating
                systems that are not only functional but also delightful to use.
                I am captivated by the intricate communication between system
                components, the protocols they use, message exchange, security,
                latency, and overall health status. I am always on the lookout
                for delicious, well-functioning systems that make me fall in
                love with technology all over again. üçúüòã
